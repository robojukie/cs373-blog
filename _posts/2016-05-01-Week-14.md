title: "Week 14: The final stretch!"
---
*What did you do this past week?*   
Completely finish our project!  We were the first group to present on Wednesday.  Presentations were limited to 15 minutes long.  At first we were worried we wouldn’t be able to fill up the time after doing a practice run, but it turns out 15 minutes is not very long when you’re going through your entire project and critiques.  None of the groups have had trouble meeting the time limit.  On Monday we went over patterns, we’ve been doing a lot of java lately.  I hope this doesn’t get too confusing on the exam.

Overall, I’m okay with the way our project turned out.  I spent a lot of time customizing everything, so no button, container, link, or font is a templated version.  As far as I can tell we are the only group who does not have default Bootstrap or other template elements.  I do wish our search functionality worked better and that I spent a little bit more time on overall aesthetics so that we would have more images across our pages, or at least used the images we have in a more interesting way.  Afterall, as a travel site, it should inspire people to visit new places.  I also would change the coloring for the search bar icon - I was experimenting, but didn’t know what the best look would be.

*What’s in your way?*   
Our algo exam is the day before our SWE exam, so studying for both will be difficult.  The upside to this is that we don’t have a final exam during finals week for either class.

*What will you do next week?*   
Hopefully finish both cheatsheets for SWE and algo by tomorrow.  For SWE I plan on going through Downing’s schedule and corresponding code, plus the Google doc, then practicing writing things for the test files.  I’ll probably try to meet up with my project group and practice problems with them, as well as do some HackerRank challenges.
I’m excited because it’s the last week of this semester for me!  Spiceworks, where I’ll be interning this summer, sends all the interns links and topics to study beforehand, so it’ll be fun to have that to work on once this week is over.

**Tip of the Week**   
HackerRank has a set of problems specifically for [Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python/py-introduction), including closures and decorators, which I imagine will be on this exam.  They also have [SQL](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/sql/select), [Relational Algebra](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/databases/relational-algebra), and [Regex](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/regex/re-introduction) challenges, all topics we’ve discussed this semester, specifically the second half.  I haven’t tried all of the challenges, but they seem like they would be a good review of things we should know for our exam.
