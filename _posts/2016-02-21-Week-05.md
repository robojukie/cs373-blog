What a week.  

What did you do this past week?   
My partner and I completed and turned in our Netflix project. In class, the material is getting somewhat more challenging to keep track of/remember. I missed a quiz question on Wednesday because I couldn’t see the difference in the first 2 questions quickly enough.  I also missed the quiz on Friday so I’m a little sad my quiz average dropped.  I forgot to keep up with my 30 second habit as well, and can’t remember the details of what we learned as easily.  We learned about using yield, which is interesting since I have never seen something like that before.  One thing I like about class is how Downing shows you multiple ways to write something that does the same time thing and talks about what makes one way better or different than another.

What’s in your way?   
Nothing!!! Well, besides our Algo exam on Monday.  But after that I won’t have homework in either class, so I can use it to really prepare for the SWE exam in less than two weeks, as well as work on some things I’ve been doing on the side.  And also I’ve just been feeling less focused/tired lately.

What will you do next week?   
Study for the upcoming exam, get some rest to feel more refreshed and focused.  Work on a project for Modern Web Apps, which is a class I’m sitting in on.  

***Tip of the Week***   
To prepare for our last few projects, I’ve been trying to get practice/learn Python and JavaScript.  Coursera has a [Python for Everybody Specialization] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python), so I’m going through it as quickly as possible.  You can get through the courses much faster than the schedule (I speed up and fast forward through the videos) since it is tailored to complete beginners.  It’s in Python 2, but still helpful because you can look up some differences and I’ve heard it’s useful to know Python 2 since much of existing code today is still in Python 2.  HackerRank also has a 7 days of JavaScript challenge to brush up and learn some JavaScript. Here’s[Week 1](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/7days-javascript/challenges) (challenge over) and [Week 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/javascript-week2) (challenge upcoming 2/29).  Another source to learn JavaScript which I worked out on over winter break is [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/map).  This is really cool because you it’s a full stack development course in JavaScript, and if you complete everything, at the end you also work on a real project for a non-profit.  There is even a Meetup for it in Austin.  All of these resources are free!
